  Maha Shivaratri is a Hindu festival celebrated annually to worship the deity Shiva, between February and March.[3] According to the Hindu calendar, the festival is observed on the fourteenth day of the first half (night start with darkness - waning) of the lunar month of Phalguna.[3][4] The festival commemorates the marriage of Shiva and Parvati,[5] and the occasion of Shiva performing his ritual dance called tandava.[6][7]

It is a notable festival in Hinduism, marking a remembrance of "overcoming darkness and ignorance" in life and the world. It is observed by remembering Shiva and chanting prayers, fasting, and meditating on ethics and virtues such as honesty, non-injury to others, charity, forgiveness, and the discovery of Shiva.[4] Ardent devotees stay awake throughout this night. Others visit one of the Shiva temples or go on a pilgrimage to the Jyotirlingams. The festival is believed to have originated in 5th century BCE.
